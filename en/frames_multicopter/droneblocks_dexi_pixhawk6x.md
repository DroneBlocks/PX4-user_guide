## Key Information

DEXI comes in two flavors:

- **Solderless Kit Version**
    -  The solderless kit version comes with all components pre-soldered and is pretty much plug and play. For example, instead of soldering your motors directly to the ESC we will provide you with MR30 connectors.


- **Ready to Fly Version**
    - The RTF version of the DEXI kit is pre-built at the warehouse, flashed with PX4, calibrated, TX/RX bound, and ready to go. All you need to do is charge your batteries and get ready to fly/code your autonomous missions.
