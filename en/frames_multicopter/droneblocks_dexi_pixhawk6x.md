## Key Information

DEXI comes in two flavors:

- **[Solderless Kit Version](https://droneblocks.io/program/dexi-5-px4-stem-drone-kit/)**
    -  The solderless kit version comes with all components pre-soldered and is pretty much plug and play. For example, instead of soldering your motors directly to the ESC we will provide you with MR30 connectors.


- **[Ready to Fly Version](https://droneblocks.io/program/dexi-5-px4-stem-drone-kit/)**
    - The RTF version of the DEXI kit is pre-built at the warehouse, flashed with PX4, calibrated, TX/RX bound, and ready to go. All you need to do is charge your batteries and get ready to fly/code your autonomous missions.

## Kit Hardware

Regardless of which flavor of DEXI you purchase, you will receive all of the components listed below. The difference comes down to whether you decide to build DEXI yourself or order it completely assembled.
